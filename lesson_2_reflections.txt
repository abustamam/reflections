## What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it? ##

Git creates a .git folder to store all the metadata, such as commit history, commit contents, etc.

## How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository? What value do you think it offers?

The repository includes the commit history, and the working directory is the directory you're working out of (e.g, the directory on your hard drive).

The staging area is a stage between the WD and the repo, and lets you review what will be added before it is actually added. You can also add one file at a time to the staging area, and then commit the entire staging area to the repo.
