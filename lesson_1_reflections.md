## How did viewing a diff between two versions of a file help you see the bug that was introduced? ##

I was able to clearly pinpoint the bug since it showed me what the difference between the two files was.

## How could having easy access to the entire history of a file make you a more efficient programmer in the long term? ##

It would be easy to view older versions of a file in case I made a mistake.

## What do you think are the pros and cons of manually choosing when to create a commit, like you do in Git, vs having versions automatically saved, like Google docs does? ##

One of the benefits of manually choosing when to commit is that you have absolute control over your commit history. You can have semantic versioning that makes sense, such as v 1.0.1 which has a few bug fixes over initial release 1.0.0. 

Google Docs would have multiple multiple versions and it would be difficult to see the semantic difference between the changes. 

One of the detriments would be the fact that it leaves a lot of room for user error, such as forgetting to commit. 

## Why do you think some version control systems, like Git, allow saving multiple files in one commit, while others, like Google Docs, treat each file separately? ##

Google Docs seems to be made for online storage of documents, which typically are never related to one another. So it only makes sense that it would track one at a time. 

Git on the other hand was created to maintain code, and a program is rarely contained in one single file. So it requires tracking multiple files for one single feature.

## How can you use the commands git log and git diff to view the history of files?

Git log will show the commit history. You can use git diff to compare commits, and therefore see which files have changed in between certain commits.

## How might using version control make you more confident to make changes that could break something? ##

Easy! Since everything is version controlled, I can fiddle around with everything knowing I can go back to an earlier commit if something breaks. 

## Now that you have your workspace set up, what do you want to try using Git for? ##

I want to use Git to play around with open source applications and also creating my own!
