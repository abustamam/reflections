## When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?  ##

Using remote repositories can be handy because we can easily make changes and make the commit all in one go. 

## Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository? ##

If I'm making changes to an open source project and a pull request gets accepted, I might not want that pull request to be on my local repo because I may be making a change that doesn't need that pull request.
